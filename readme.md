**Book a Medicine:** Easily search for and book your required medicines from the comfort of your home. The app provides a comprehensive database of medicines, including their descriptions, uses, dosages, and potential side effects.

**Never Miss a Dose:** Set up personalized reminders for taking your medications on time. DoseWise allows you to create customized schedules for each medication, specifying the dosage and frequency. The app will send you timely reminders, ensuring that you never miss a dose and helping you maintain a consistent medication routine.

**Optimize Medication Stock:** Keep track of your medication supply and receive alerts when it's time to refill.
